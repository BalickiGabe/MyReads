# MyReads Project

MyReads is a React.js application that allows users to categorize books onto shelves: **Currently Reading**, **Want to Read**, and **Read**. Users can seamlessly move books between shelves through an intuitive, responsive interface. The app also features a **Search Page** where users can look up new books, pulling data from a backend server. Books found via search can be categorized onto shelves and viewed on the home page. The shelf state of each book (whether already categorized or part of a search result) is fully managed.

## Features
- **Categorize Books**: Organize your books into predefined shelves.
- **Move Between Shelves**: Easily switch a book's shelf category.
- **Search for New Books**: Discover new reads from a dynamic search page.
- **Synced Shelf States**: See your book's status updated across the app.

## Get Started

The application was bootstrapped with `create-react-app` and is simple to set up. Here's how:

1. Install all project dependencies:
