# MyReads Project

This is a react.js application that allows the user to categorize books onto shelves (Currently Reading, Want to Read, and Read). The user is able to move books between shelves through the responsive user interface. The app allows users to search for new books from a search page wich pulls book data from a backend server as well. Books found in the search page can be categorized to shelves and be seen on the home page. The shelf state of every book, both on the users shelves and in the search response, is managed.
